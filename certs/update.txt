These certs were an attempt to prompt proper SSL verification between 
my local machine and the web pages I am scraping, but as of now these
certificates do not work. I am instead just using some of the built-in
functionality of the requests library to forego all SSL verification
entirely. This is inadvisable, but since I am really only using the
scraper to get text to populate some pages on the app, I am not too
concerned about security risks.
