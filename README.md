# Catholic Terps App

Welcome to the unofficial Catholic Terps Study App! This application is intended to provide
users (predominantly members of the Catholic Student Center at the University of Maryland,
College Park) with seamless access to fully up to date information from the Catholic Center
in addition to various useful sources for enhancing understanding of the Catholic faith,
including sections for Catholic news, the Bible, Catholic history, and prayer routines. Later,
more complete versions of the application may also help administrators manage information that
could be useful for the maintenance and execution of Catholic Center activities. The current
implementation is far from complete, but steady progress is being made on the application everyday!
